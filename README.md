-------------------------------------------HTML & CSS-------------------------------------------

Hello! This is my first HTML and CSS website I made as a part of my final year college project right before covid. 
The project was based on any Sports Club and I made the project on one of the famous sport club Juventus.

So, this HTML & CSS website is just a small website which is not resposnive and is just a demonstration or a reference point of what I learned in my first year college.
This could still be a helping point for beginners as I have used a lot of codes and page alignment which might be helpful for someone, so have a deep look and enjoy.

Thanks.
