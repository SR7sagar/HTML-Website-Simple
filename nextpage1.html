Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed that he had “several offers to leave Real Madrid” before deciding to link up with Juventus in a €100 million (£90m/$114m) deal.
As the Portuguese was sending records tumbling in the Spanish capital, while taking his collection of Ballons d’Or and Champions League crowns to five apiece, a move elsewhere appeared unlikely.
That had been hints that a switch could be made, but the Blancos were expected to retain the services of an iconic figure and do everything in their power to prevent an exit.The background is that a year ago, Perez said he would increase Ronaldo's wages. Cristiano was waiting for an offer, and meanwhile, Lionel Messi got a new contract worth €41m net per year, Neymar is earning €35m net per year, and he is only earning €21m net per year.

"He also feels there is a lot of talk about Neymar. When Cristiano won the Ballon d'Or, Perez said that if Neymar wanted to win the Ballon d'Or he needed to move to Real Madrid. Cristiano didn't like that, but when he threatened them with leaving, he felt Real Madrid didn't do enough to try and keep him.

"It's all very confusing. He wants to leave but at the same time he wants to be stopped. Anyway, Real Madrid are happy to let him go, but they want him to say publicly that he's leaving, so the finger of blame goes to him and they can give him a spectacular send-off.</p>

			<h2><em><span style="margin: 10%"><u>Guardiola: Foden will not be loaned out:</u></span></em></h2>

<p class="transfer">-Pep Guardiola says Phil Foden will not be leaving Manchester City on loan after the 18-year-old starred in the club’s 7-0 rout of Rotherham in the FA Cup third round.
Guardiola started a host of senior players but it was the young English midfielder was a stand-out performer, scoring his first senior goal.
Afterwards it was suggested he would benefit from a loan but Guardiola said: “No way, impossible, he is going to stay with us many years.
“I think the guys who come from the academy and train with these guys, they learn every day, more than I can say. The rhythm increase. If he plays, it is because we believe he can play. It is not because he is a Manchester City fan or a nice guy, no, it is because we believe he can do it."

Italian giants hoping to bring deal forward.

Juventus are keen to sign Aaron Ramsey this month rather than wait for the midfielder's contract to expire at the end of the season, report Calciomercato.
Ramsey has reportedly agreed to join the Bianconeri in the summer on a five-year deal with worth in the region of €10million (£8.9m/$11.4m) a year.
However, Juve are considering bringing the deal forward to this month and are willing to pay around £10million (€11.1m/$12.7m) for the Welshman, though Arsenal are believed to want at least £20million (€22.3m/$25.4m).

<h2 class="short"><em><u>Juventus are ready to rival Bayern Munich for the signature of Chelsea FC teenager Callum
 Hudson-Odoi, according to a report in Italy.</u></em></h2>

<p class="news">-Italian media outlet Calciomercato, quoting journalist Nicola Balice, is reporting that Juve are keeping tabs on the 18-year-old’s situation at the Stamford Bridge outfit.

The same article states that Blues want to receive an offer in the region of €40m for the teenager, which has proved a stumbling block in negotiations with Bayern Munich.

According to the same story, reigning Serie A champions Juve are trying to work out how much Chelsea FC will demand for the England Under-19 international.

Hudson-Odoi has limited experience in the Chelsea FC first-team but the west London outfit are still said to be asking for a transfer fee around €40m for the Bayern target.

The 18-year-old has made four appearances in the Europa League this season, scoring his first Chelsea FC goal in a 4-0 victory over Greek side PAOK at Stamford Bridge.

Hudson-Odoi made his first Premier League appearance as a first-half substitute in Chelsea FC’s 2-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road on Boxing Day.

He also featured during the 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup third round on Saturday.

Chelsea FC won the race to sign United States international Christian Pulisic in a £58m deal from Bundesliga outfit Borussia Dortmund in the January transfer window before the American playmaker was loaned back to the Bundesliga outfit.
